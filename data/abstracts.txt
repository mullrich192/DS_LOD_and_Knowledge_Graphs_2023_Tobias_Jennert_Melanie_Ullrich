Efficient emergency response for disasters need systematic response preparedness and plan. Distributed computer simulation drilling can help to perfect the disaster response plan. Since the disaster response simulation drilling participants are geographically distributed and subjected to different organizations, they need to communicate via the Internet. The HLA-based distributed simulation has been widely used, but presently it is difficult to implement a HLA-based distributed simulation application that needs resources from multi-organizations or communicates on the public Internet environment. The advantages of computational Grid in distributed resources collaboration and management provide a new development opportunity for distributed simulation. In this paper, a distributed simulation framework which realizes extending HLA/RTI to Internet based on Grid service is proposed. The framework aims to the advantage of Grid technology as well as the reusability and interoperability of simulation modules. The results of experiments of the prototype indicate the feasibility of the framework, which provide a platform for disaster emergency response drilling distributed simulation over Internet. At the end of paper, the future development plan has been discussed.
Rationale, aims and objectives : Healthcare systems are continuously challenged to develop new ways of working to meet the demands of an increasing prevalence of multi-morbid long term illness. Care planning has been proposed as one solution. This analysis used the Normalisation Process Theory as a framework to identify precursors of embeddedness of care planning in 10 primary care practices. Methods : GPs, Nurses and Practice Managers from the selected practices took part in a series of collaborative learning workshops and a training programme. The data informing this article derive from 15 semi-structured interviews and from observational data collected during 4 collaborative meetings. Results : A key step in the meetings was collaboratively to differentiate the care planning function from previous practice. Later interviews showed a clear movement towards the generation and implementation of pragmatic solutions. These included the adaptation of pre-existing tools, IT systems, call and re-call procedures and documentation and communication procedures in order to implement care planning for diverse patient needs. Implementing the care planning function entailed a renegotiation of roles between clinicians as well as with patients, the explicit inclusion of practice managers and a consideration of relationships with secondary care and other local services. Participants provided anecdotal evidence of the benefits of care planning and reported having received positive feedback from patients. Conclusions : The learning collaborative enabled participants to shape care planning to fit their individual practice contexts, in terms of resources, structures and systems as well as in terms of the patient population. It emphasised the need for differentiation from prior practice, individual and communal specification and internalisation and fostered a sense of ownership.
Glyoxal, which was the strong mutagen formed by ozonation of humic substances, was treated with granular activated carbon (GAC) and the behavior of glyoxal was investigated. Glyoxal itself was adsorbed well on GAC at pH 5–7. But, glyoxal increased by GAC treatment of ozonated humic substances when the ozone dose was insufficient to decolorize the humic substances. The precursors of glyoxal may be among other ozonated products which may be changed to glyoxal on GAC.
The Introduction problematizes established understandings of universities in the British empire and introduces the main arguments of the book. Pointing to the national focus of existing scholarship and to its disconnected nature, it argues for the need to pay attention to the long-distance ties that linked universities and academics in Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. Doing so, it suggests, forces historians to rethink the relationship between sociability, space and knowledge practice in the period before the Second World War, revealing an expansive British academic world that was characterised by irregular geographies of access and exchange.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an efficient technique for recognizing the state of elements. However, the effects of X-ray irradiation on change in the chemical state are sometimes ignored, which may impair the understanding of the environmental behavior of these elements. This study determined the change in the U 4f spectra induced by X-ray irradiation during XPS detection. For U(VI) on non-semiconductors, X-ray irradiation led to a negative shift of U 4f7/2 to ∼ 380.8 eV due to the break of the uranyl molecules, but not resulting in U(IV) species. However, owing to the photocatalytic reduction of U(VI), the irradiation of U(VI) loaded semiconductors rapidly induced the negative shift of U 4f7/2 peak to ∼ 379.8 eV, which is the characteristic of U(IV). Moreover, apparent photo-reduction occurred even if the samples were far from the center of the X-ray beam (>3971 μm). Based on these findings, methods for reducing potential error due to X-ray irradiation are suggested, including using the minimum scan time, measuring uranium-containing samples first or independent of other samples, and using X-ray of lower intensity. The results indicated that X-ray induced alteration to the chemical states must be considered when using X-ray techniques.
Abstract Background The progression of acute-to-chronic atopic dermatitis is accompanied by multiple helper T-cell cytokine responses, but the mechanisms and relative importance of these changes remain unclear. There is no animal model for atopic dermatitis that recapitulates these cytokine responses. Objective We sought to build a novel mouse model for atopic dermatitis (AD) that recapitulates these helper T-cell responses and some dynamic changes in cytokine responses in the progression of AD. Methods Female BALB/c mice were subjected to the application of dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and ovalbumin (OVA) to induce AD-like dermatitis. Skin lesions and serum were collected from mice in the acute and chronic phases to detect changes in cytokine responses and other features of AD. Results Combined application of DNFB and OVA successfully induced AD-like dermatitis and histological changes as well as epidermal barrier dysfunction. In the acute phase of AD-like dermatitis, Th2-associated cytokines were mainly increased in serum and skin lesions. In the chronic phase of AD-like dermatitis, Th2-associated cytokines were still highly expressed, while Th1- and Th17-associated cytokines were also gradually increased. Compared with the acute phase, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway was highly expressed in the chronic phase of AD-like dermatitis. Conclusion The combined application of DNFB and OVA could be used to build a new mouse model for atopic dermatitis. This mouse model recapitulates the helper T-cell responses and some dynamic changes in cytokine responses in the progression of acute-to-chronic in human AD. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the chronicity of AD.
Objective To study the method and effect of the lung cancer treated by stereotactic radiotherapy(SRT). Method 52 patients treated by SRT are compared with 57 patients treted by conventional fraction radiotherapy(CRR). Result SRT group: the local TCP(tumor control rate) was 92. 3% (48/52), the disappeared rate was 88. 5% (46/52), one survial year rate 63. 5% (33/52); CFR: TCP was 64. 9%, the disappeared rate was 64. 9% (37/57 ), one survial year rate 42. l% (24/57 ). (SRT vs. CFR, P 0. 01 ). Conclusion SRT is able to improve local TCP and the disappeared rate, and shorten radiation course of treatment.
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of treasury management practices at Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM). Respondents of the research are the Bursar and a senior officer of the UUM’S Bursar Department. The type of research is a comparative study and the instruments of information collection used were through questionnaires and interviews. Descriptive method was employed in analyzing the data. The gathered information was compared with the Code of Practice on Treasury management by The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA), which is being adopted by University of Oxford, United Kingdom. Result of the research shows that the UUM’S Bursar Department does not fully adopted all the Code of Practice on Treasury management by The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). However, UUM has partially adopted the treasury management practices such as in cash flow forecasting, investment, money laundering, staff training, reporting, performance measurement, and budgeting, accounting and auditing. This study is able to create awareness in understanding the importance and the function of treasury management. In reality, treasury management practice becomes more relevant to UUM in view that its stakeholder, the Government of Malaysia, might reduce future financial assistance. Moreover, UUM is already experiencing reduction of financial resources from government. Therefore, to ensure the optimal practice of treasury management, a framework on treasury management has been established to act as a guidance for the Bursar Department of UUM. Lastly, further research need to be done involving other public higher education institutions, so that a standard policy on treasury management practices for the whole public higher education institutions in Malaysia can be made a reality.
Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are important vectors of neoliberal globalization in India. Despite facing widespread resistance against the proposed land acquisition for these zones, they are still being promoted across the country. We argue that the wealth redistribution to the country's elites and the fractured resistance movements enable neoliberalism and its practices to grow in the countryside. Using a private sector SEZ in Gurgaon as a case study, this article explores how special economic zoning, as a neoliberal policy, has been implicated in the spatialized production of poverty. We also show that the main actors who promote neoliberalism in India (the state and the large‐scale urban private sector) have found a seemingly unlikely ally in rural India in the form of farmers with large landholdings, rural elites who are willing to let go of their land under certain conditions. The data for the article was collected in India in 2009–10.

In the paper ‘Revisiting Dix’s RMS Velocity’ (James, 2018) it was shown that there is no single velocity function that will accurately correct NMO for all the offsets in a seismic shot record. For the simplest possible model, with more than one layer NMO, velocity is not hyperbolic. Therefore, since the idea that ‘NMO velocities can be approximated by RMS averages of interval velocities’ is pervasive in seismic data processing we need some adjustment to our procedures. The impetus to study RMS velocities came from the practice of muting far offsets when performing AVA/AVO analysis and the far offsets were not flat in time after NMO. With the muting, the information at far offsets was discarded. Historically NMO velocities were picked directly and so it was never necessary to have reflections that were not flat after correction. Muting for NMO was restricted to the region where refractions and or reflections interfered with each other.

Esta tesis consiste en la aplicacion de la metodologia pragmantica al analisis de un corpus previamente seleccionado y jusfiticado entre la narrativa infantil publicada, tnato en Espana como en el resto de Europa, en los ultimos treinta anos.
Despues de exponer cual es el estado en el que se encuntran los estudios desarrollados hasta ahora sobre literatura infantil. Se analizan los elementos pratextuales presentes en el discurso narrativo infantil, el peritexto editorial en el que se mueven las narraciones y las instancias enunciativas propias de la narracion: autor textual, narrador, narratario y lector textual.
La finalidad que persigue este estudio es profundizar en el conocimiento de las estrategias que diferencian el discurso narrativo infantil del discurso literario destinado unicamente a los adultos. Con esta finalida, se insiste en la duplicidad del lector textual como uno de los motores de las innovaciones que presenta el discurso narrativo infantil de lso ultimos anos, tanto en lo que respecta a la introduccion de modelos propios de la literatura adulta como en los que concierne a la creaccion de modelos exclusivos de la literatura infantil.
We study semi-analytical time-dependent solutions of the relativistic MHD equations for the fields and the fluid emerging from a spherical source. We assume uniform expansion of the field and the fluid and a polytropic relation between the density and the pressure of the fluid. The expansion velocity is small near the base but approaches the speed of light at the light sphere where the flux terminates. We find self-consistent solutions for the density and the magnetic flux. The details of the solution depend on the ratio of the toroidal and the poloidal magnetic field, the ratio of the energy carried by the fluid and the electromagnetic field and the maximum velocity it reaches.
Open-loop control is known to be an effective strategy for controlling self-excited periodic oscillations, known as thermoacoustic instability, in turbulent combustors. Here, we present experimental observations and a synchronization model for the suppression of thermoacoustic instability achieved by rotating the otherwise static swirler in a lab-scale turbulent combustor. Starting with the state of thermoacoustic instability in the combustor, we find that a progressive increase in the swirler rotation rate leads to a transition from the state of limit cycle oscillations to the low-amplitude aperiodic oscillations through a state of intermittency. To model such a transition while also quantifying the underlying synchronization characteristics, we extend the model of Dutta et al. [Phys. Rev. E 99, 032215 (2019)] by introducing a feedback between the ensemble of phase oscillators and the acoustic. The coupling strength in the model is determined by considering the effect of the acoustic and swirl frequencies. The link between the model and experimental results is quantitatively established by implementing an optimization algorithm for model parameter estimation. We show that the model is capable of replicating the bifurcation characteristics, nonlinear features of time series, probability density function, and amplitude spectrum of acoustic pressure and heat release rate fluctuations at various dynamical states observed during the transition to the state of suppression. Most importantly, we discuss the flame dynamics and demonstrate that the model without any spatial inputs qualitatively captures the characteristics of the spatiotemporal synchronization between the local heat release rate fluctuations and the acoustic pressure that underpins a transition to the state of suppression. As a result, the model emerges as a powerful tool for explaining and controlling instabilities in thermoacoustic and other extended fluid dynamical systems, where spatiotemporal interactions lead to rich dynamical phenomena.
Background Severe drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) refer to allergic reactions caused by drugs and usually present with severe skin rashes and internal damage as the main symptoms. Reporting of severe DHRs in hospitals now solely occurs through spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs), which clinicians in charge operate. An automatic identification system scrutinizes clinical notes and reports potential severe DHR cases. Objective The goal of the research was to develop an automatic identification system for mining severe DHR cases and discover more DHR cases for further study. The proposed method was applied to 9 years of data in pediatrics electronic health records (EHRs) of Beijing Children’s Hospital. Methods The phenotyping task was approached as a document classification problem. A DHR dataset containing tagged documents for training was prepared. Each document contains all the clinical notes generated during 1 inpatient visit in this data set. Document-level tags correspond to DHR types and a negative category. Strategies were evaluated for long document classification on the openly available National NLP Clinical Challenges 2016 smoking task. Four strategies were evaluated in this work: document truncation, hierarchy representation, efficient self-attention, and key sentence selection. In-domain and open-domain pretrained embeddings were evaluated on the DHR dataset. An automatic grid search was performed to tune statistical classifiers for the best performance over the transformed data. Inference efficiency and memory requirements of the best performing models were analyzed. The most efficient model for mining DHR cases from millions of documents in the EHR system was run. Results For long document classification, key sentence selection with guideline keywords achieved the best performance and was 9 times faster than hierarchy representation models for inference. The best model discovered 1155 DHR cases in Beijing Children’s Hospital EHR system. After double-checking by clinician experts, 357 cases of severe DHRs were finally identified. For the smoking challenge, our model reached the record of state-of-the-art performance (94.1% vs 94.2%). Conclusions The proposed method discovered 357 positive DHR cases from a large archive of EHR records, about 90% of which were missed by SRSs. SRSs reported only 36 cases during the same period. The case analysis also found more suspected drugs associated with severe DHRs in pediatrics.
Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNTFET) is considered one of the promising new transistors because it can avoid most of traditional Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) limitations. This paper presents a simple and accurate numerical model of coaxial gate Single Wall CNTFET (SW-CNTFET). The main feature of this model is that it can be used for low and high voltage applications, up to 2V. Furthermore, it can be used with CNT diameters varying from 1nm to 5nm. We apply the zone folding method to calculate the subband minima accurately. Our model has been compared with an exact numerical simulation. Our results show that when the gate voltage is lower than 1V the percentage error in saturation drain current is less than 1.5% but for high gate voltage (2V) the percentage of error is increased to 10%. Based on this model, the total induced carriers in the channel and the transfer characteristic curves are analyzed. Moreover, this work includes the effect of the diameter on the output characteristic curves.
Hemoperitoneum in peritoneal dialysis patients is a known but infrequent complication. Hemoperitoneum is more frequent in women because of its association with a variety of gynecologic presentations such as reflux menstruation, ovulation, endometrial tissue implants within the peritoneal cavity (endometriosis), and bleeding follicular cysts. Other intraperitoneal causes of hemoperitoneum include minor catheter or abdominal trauma, vascular anomalies, or hepatic or splenic cysts. Less frequently encountered is a presentation of hemoperitoneum from a retroperitoneal source. These presentations result either from peritoneal inflammation and subsequent peritoneal bleeding or retroperitoneal cavity pathology rupturing into the peritoneal cavity. Here, we present the case of a peritoneal dialysis patient presenting with hemoperitoneum several days after undergoing cardiac catheterization. The catheterization was complicated by a large retroperitoneal hematoma. Details of the case are reported, and other retroperitoneal causes of hemoperitoneum are reviewed.
Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH) is a flavin-dependent enzyme essential to pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis, which serves as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. A novel series of hDHODH inhibitors was developed based on a lead which was obtained by a medicinal chemistry exploration. Most compounds showed moderate to significant potency against hDHODH, compounds 5d, 5e, and 6a effectively inhibited the activities of hDHODH with IC50 values from 0.9 to 2.8 μM. Further studies showed that compound 5e also effectively suppressed proliferation of the activated PBMCs (IC50 = 20.35 μM). Surprisingly, compound 5e also showed anti-pulmonary fibrotic activity similar to that of pirfenidone in vitro assay. Therefore, compound 5e might have potential to be developed as a novel hDHODH inhibitors for autoimmune diseases therapy.
An impurity usually present in gossypol prepared from dianilihogossypol was studied and identified as monoanilinogossypol. It was an unreported compound in the literature. By analytical data it is in agreement with the formula C_(36)H_(35)O_7N, and decomposed at 272～275℃. Absorption maxima were observed at wavelengths 439～440, 311, 278, 288 and 245 nm, shoulder peaks at 464 and 390 nm. The extinction coefficient at 440 nm E_(1cm)~(1%)(CHCl_3) is 329±6, about (1/2) that of dianilinogossypol. The IR exhibit two strong absorptions at 1610cm~(-1) (-CHO)and 1590 cm~(-1) (C=N). On MS m/e 593 (M~+) is recorded. The NMR (in CDCl_3) shows the important signals: δ 11.17 (s, lH, -CHO) and δ 10.13 (d, lH, -HC=N-). The Rf value of monoanilinogossypol on TLC(silica gel-starch, solvent: benzene-chloroform-ethylacetate 40:10:3) is higher than that of gossypol and lower than that of dianilinogossypol. The pure product was pale yellow crystals. The analytical data of synthetic sample are also in agreement with above.The presence of monoanilinogossypol in gossypol interferes with the determination of the latter. Thus, it is necessary to identify the impurity with thin layer chromatography before hand.

We consider an oligopolistic market game, in which the players are competing firms in the same market of a homogeneous consumption good. The consumer side is represented by a fixed demand function. The firms decide how much to produce of a perishable consumption good, and they decide upon a number of information signals to be sent into the population in order to attract customers. Due to the minimal information provided, the players do not have a well-specified model of their environment. Our main objective is to characterize the adaptive behavior of the players in such a situation.
Purpose Focusing on firm-initiated brand communities, the purpose of this paper is to systematically examine the influence of brand community rejection on consumer evaluations and document the underlying mechanism involved. Design/methodology/approach Four empirical studies were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. Using a similar 2 × 2 study design, different subject samples and different product categories, Studies 1-3 investigated whether a brand community rejection strategy impacted strong brands differently than weak brands. Furthermore, Study 3 measured reactance as a moderator to explore the underlying process of the impact of a brand community rejection strategy on brand evaluations for different types of brands (i.e. strong vs weak). Study 4 used a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects design to examine whether justification would eliminate the negative impact of brand community rejection on subsequent brand evaluations for a weak brand. Findings Across the four studies, the findings consistently suggest that rejection from firm-initiated brand communities harms weak brands but not strong brands. In addition, by incorporating psychological reactance as a moderator of this effect, the authors uncover the process underlying the interaction between brand community rejection and brand strength. Furthermore, the paper examines the reasons that justify rejection to find a solution that eliminates the negative impact of brand community rejection on brand evaluations for weak brands. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research provides the first investigation of the effects of a brand community rejection strategy for different brands. The findings could advance the social exclusion literature and shed new light on brand community research.
In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden drei Fragen behandelt: 1.Kann die elektrischen Leitfahigkeit des Harns, die als Abfallprodukt moderner durchfluszytometrischer Harnanalysen anfallt, zur Beurteilung der Harnkonzentriertheit und der renalen Diurese herangezogen werden? 2.Welche der typischerweise im Harn gelosten Stoffe werden durch diese Messung erfast? 3.Inwiefern ist die Aussagekraft dieser Messgrosen mit den etablierten Methoden zur Bestimmung der Harnkonzentration vergleichbar?
The problem of the loosening and pullout of bone screws in cervical spine stabilisation is a significant factor in failed implantations of that spine region. Therefore, studies were undertaken to determine the impact of the loading history of bone screws of the cervical spine, inserted from the anterior approach, on the stability of the screw-bone interface. The research was conducted on vertebrae obtained from cadaver specimens of the cervical spine. Two screws were inserted into each vertebra and then pulled out with a force acting along the screw axis. The mean pullout force for the screws subjected to cyclic preloading was 355.2+/-74.4 N, and for the screws subjected to direct pullout it was 411.0+/-78 N (p<0.05). The research results show a significant impact of bone tissue preloading with a cyclic variable force on the pullout force obtained. For the preloaded bone screws the recorded rupture strength of the implant-vertebral body interface was by 16% lower compared to the screws pulled out without preloading. The values presented also show a strong correlation between the bone density and the pullout force obtained after cyclic loading with the strength normal to the screw axis.
Multilinear embedding estimates for the fractional Laplacian are obtained in terms of functionals defined over a hyperbolic surface. Convolution estimates used in the proof enlarge the classical framework of the convolution algebra for Riesz potentials to include the critical endpoint index and provide new realizations for fractional integral inequalities that incorporate restriction to smooth submanifolds. Results developed here are modeled on the space-time estimate used by Klainerman and Machedon in their proof of uniqueness for the Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy.
Olive tree (Olea europaea L.) leaf is known to have a number of bioactive properties being antioxidant, antihypertensive, antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and antimicrobial. In this study, the immunomodulatory roles of Olive tree (Olea europaea L.) leaf against oxidative damage caused by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated. In the study, four groups were formed; namely, (i) Control Group: Yeast only planted group; (ii) CCl4 Group: Group given CCl4 (15 mM); (iii) Olive Tree Leaf Group: The group given olive tree leaf (10%); and (iv) Olive Tree Leaf + CCl4 Group: Olive tree leaf (10%) + CCl4 (15 mM) given group. Cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were grown at 30 °C for 1, 3, 5, and 24 hours. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione levels (GSH), cell growth and catalase (CAT) activity measurements were determined by spectrophotometer. Total protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the Bradford protein method. According to the results obtained; compared to the CCl4 group, cell growth (1, 3, 5 and 24 hours), total protein synthesis, and GSH and CAT activities (24 hours) increased in olive tree leaf groups, while MDA level (24 hours) decreased. Thanks to its strong bioactive properties, olive tree leaf has been found to increase cell growth and total protein synthesis by decreasing CCl4 induced oxidative stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae culture. It has been concluded that if the olive tree leaf is used regularly, it will be beneficial in eliminating many health problems.
Sensation novelists famously pilfered newspapers for scandalous and evocative plotlines, crafting tales of thrilling exploits that posed questions about mid-Victorian society. These novels are activist in nature because they present individuals possessing secret information about social institutions and ask whether those same individuals have the agency to act upon this information. The secret knowledge that propels the plots of Charles Reade’s It Is Never Too Late to Mend: A Matter-of-Fact Romance (1856) and Felicia Skene’s Hidden Depths (1866) conceals corruption, empowering those who hold such information to either perpetuate the corruption or contribute to transparency between individuals and within institutions. This power demonstrates the potential for social activism inherent in sensation novels.
Coumarin-linked heterocycles represent privileged structural subunits and are welldistributed in naturally occurring compounds with immense biological activities. Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are becoming a valuable tool for synthesizing structurally diverse molecular entities. On the other hand, the last year has seen a tremendous outburst in modifying chemical processes to make them sustainable for the betterment of our environment. The application of aqueous medium in organic synthesis is fulfilling some of the goals of ‘green and sustainable chemistry’ as it has some advantages over the traditional synthetic methods in terms of reaction rates, yields, purity of the products, product selectivity, etc. Hence, significant progress has been made in recent years. In the present review, we provide an overview of the recent developments of multicomponent synthesis of biologically relevant coumarin linked and fused heterocyclic compounds carried out from 2015 till today in an aqueous medium.
Sufficient closure of intraoral defects can be challenging. Various methods of tissue transfer have been presented in the literature. From skin grafts to microvascular flaps, most techniques used for intraoral reconstruction use skin to line out the oral cavity to guarantee an epithelial surface. Native mucosa tolerates the moist environment of the oral cavity, whereas skin flaps do to just a certain extent. This may lead to chronic inflammation of the flap-skin. Under rare circumstances, these histologic changes can enhance the risk for malignant transformation of the skin graft.We present a case of a patient who derived a squamous cell carcinoma in the skin island of a jump flap raised from the abdominal wall 30 years earlier. The flap was used to close a very wide palatal cleft. The patient had no history of malignancy, smoking, drinking, or other risk factors.To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on carcinoma in a skin flap in a patient without any history of intraoral malignancy. Although malignant transformations of skin grafts are very rare and usually appear years after the reconstruction, one should be aware that the moist environment can lead to chronic inflammation of the dermis of flap. This fact may increase the risk of malignant transformation in a skin graft.
A survey of continuous twin high cast-rolling in the world was reviewed. By 2000, there are about 400 continuous cast-rolling lines in the world, the throughout for them is up to 3600 kt/a; the continuous cast-rolling lines in China are about 90, the throughout for them is about 718 kt/a. There are 27 state-of-the-art thin-gauge high-speed roll Casters for aluminium sheet products in the world.
A 77-year-old woman with cryptogenic cirrhosis presented with a 3 cm contrast enhancing mass in the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe seen on triphasic computed tomographic (CT) examination of the abdomen. Her alpha fetoprotein (AFP) was 48.4 ng/ml (,6 ng/ml). An ultrasound guided transcutaneous single pass radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the mass was performed without immediate complications. Seven months later the patient presented with upper abdominal pain. A repeat CT scan demonstrated a new lobulated contrast enhancing mass in the subcutaneous fat of the midline anterior abdominal wall (white arrow). A 3 cm hypodense area in the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe (black arrow), consistent with the site of previous RFA, was also observed. The repeat serum AFP was now 999 ng/ml. The subcutaneous mass represents needle tract seeding complicating the RFA. RFA is a thermal treatment technique designed to produce localized tumor destruction. Its use is particularly attractive in high-risk operative candidates such as our elderly patient with a localized HCC in a cirrhotic liver. RFA can be performed percutaneously, laparoscopically or at the time of laparotomy. Treatment related complications occur in 10% of patients in most series and include pain, hemoperitoneum, capsular hematoma, pneumothorax, infection and portal thrombosis. Local tumor recurrence at the RFA site is infrequent (3.6%) [1]. Needle tract seeding, in up to 12.5% of cases, is now also recognized as a long-term complication of RFA [2]. This particular complication occurs predominantly in surface or immediate subcapsular lesions such as in this patient. Proposed explanations include the larger needles used in RFA compared with other forms of local therapy such as percutaneous ethanol injection. The J-hooks used in the multiple array RFA electrodes can also potentially pierce the capsule in peripheral tumors resulting in local seeding. This case highlights the risk of tumor seeding after RFA of subcapsular HCC.
&#x0D; Os denominados Planos Econômicos foram políticas monetárias aplicadas durante os governos brasileiros dos anos de 1980 a 1990/2000, visando estabilização da moeda nacional, então acentuadamente inflacionada. A ausência de correção monetária pelos devidos índices de inflação apurados no período gerou os denominados expurgos inflacionários que levou milhares de poupadores ao Judiciário brasileiro. Finalmente, quando a decisão final acerca da constitucionalidade das medidas chegou à Corte Constitucional, por intermédio de uma Ação de Descumprimento de Preceito Fundamental, houve sobrestamento da questão nas instâncias inferiores, representando “cerca de 70% dos processos sobrestados nas Cortes do País aguardando a resolução da controvérsia em repercussão geral, segundo dados do ‘Supremo em ação 2017’”. Ocorre que o Supremo Tribunal Federal não se debruçou sobre o mérito da ação, homologando um acordo entre agentes econômicos envolvidos na controvérsia.

The class of quasisymmetric mappings on the real axis was first introduced by Beurling and Ahlfors in 1956. In 1980 Tukia and Väisälä considered these mappings between general metric spaces. In our paper we generalize the concept of a quasisymmetric mapping to the case of general semimetric spaces and study some properties of these mappings. In particular, conditions under which quasisymmetric mappings preserve triangle functions, Ptolemy's inequality and the relation "to lie between" are found. Considering quasisymmetric mappings between semimetric spaces with different triangle functions we give a new estimate for the ratio of diameters of two subsets, which are images of two bounded subsets. This result generalizes the well-known Tukia-Väisälä inequality. Moreover, we study connections between quasisymmetric mappings and weak similarities which form a special class of mappings between semimetric spaces.

They are at altitudes of 3,230 to 3,620 m, triangular to rectangular in ground plan, slope a few degrees downvalley with nearly all blocks or boulders tightly packed with a flat face upward, and made of local bedrock or till. These alpine subnival boulder pavements may be due to the joint effort of frost action, meltwater saturation and removal of fine sediment, and rotation and flattening of blocks by rock weight, snow pressure, and possible snow creep.

<h3>Background</h3> The reduction of finger joint space width in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with joint damage and physical function loss of the finger joints which results in physical disability. <h3>Objectives</h3> The Z-Score is a new computer based technique to measure joint space reduction on hand radiographs in RA in a gender- and age-independent way. The aim of this study was to quantify longitudinal changes of joint space width by the Z-Score in comparison to the Sharp joint space narrowing score. <h3>Methods</h3> 94 RA-patients (68 women and 26 men) participating at the LEMERADIX REGISTER (Retrospective Comparison of Leflunomide and Methotrexate in Rheumatoid Arthritis by Digital Radiogrammetry (DXR) and Computer-aided Joint Space Analysis (CAJSA)) as a prospectively planned, comparative, multicenter retrospective study were included. 53 patients were treated with 15 mg methotrexate per week and 41 patients were treated with 10 mg leflunomide per day over an observation period of 1.8 years. Hand radiographs were acquired at baseline and after 1.8 years. The quantification of finger joint space width of the metacarpal-phalangeal articulations (MCP) was performed by the Z-score using the computer-assisted joint space analysis (Version 1.3.6; Sectra; Sweden) and the Sharp joint space narrowing score. <h3>Results</h3> For both treatment arms (leflunomide and methotrexate) no significant changes of the Sharp Erosion Score and Sharp joint space narrowing score were observed over the observation period of 1.8 years. The median Sharp joint space narrowing score of the first and second measurement was 1. For the methotrexate treated patients the Z-Score (MCP total) decreased (-0.13 SD) from 0.08 SD (initial measurement) to -0.05 SD (second measurement). Regarding, the leflunomide-group the Z-Score (MCP total) was not significantly reduced (-0.03 SD) from 0.16 SD (initial measurement) to 0.13 SD (second measurement). <h3>Conclusions</h3> In this longitudinal head to head comparison based on the LEMERADIX-Register the conventional scoring of the finger joint space width by the Sharp joint space narrowing score revealed no change of the median joint space width. The automatically quantification of the joint space width using the Z-Score was able to detect changes of finger joint space width in patient groups with different treatment arms. Consequently, the automatic quantification of finger joint space width by the Z-Score is a sensitive technique for the quantification of joint space reduction and treatment effects. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> A.

However, urodynamic studies are time-consuming and not easy to perform as well as being extremely invasive and distressing especially for children. Modern urodynamic studies are widely used in many clinics such as urology, pediatry and pediatric surgery. Combining fluoroscopic video imaging during urodynamic studies can significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy. The addition of video not only allows for real-time measurement of the exact detrusor pressure when urinary leakage or vesicoureteral reflux occurs, but also reveals the overall shape and contour of the bladder and bladder neck during filling and voiding. Despite the increasing use of urodynamics in clinics, to evaluate the results is still a problem for many clinicians. An easy analysis is the most important point for good urodynamics. Although, according to the efforts of International Continence Society (ICS) and International Chil dren’s Continence Society (ICCS) to simplify the terminology and practice of urodynamic studies, there is still conflictions about the interpretation of the urodynamic results. In modern urodynamics it is mandatory to have both a clear-cut terminology and normal values with reference to the studies. In this review article we aimed to make easier to understand urodynamic results for our colleagues.

In Being in Time I articulate and defend a theory of diachronic identity based on a new account of the relation between objects and time. Traditionally, the relation between objects and time has been considered to be a direct one, analogous to the one they have with space, and accordingly called location. In my dissertation, I argue that this locative approach is metaphysically problematic insofar as it commits us to questionable consequences about the nature of objects or about the metaphysics of location. In particular, the locative approach, depending on how it is specified, requires that objects do not persist, have multiple exact locations, divide into temporal parts, or are extended simples. In place of this locative approach, and drawing from an analysis of our temporal semantics, I put forward an account of the relation between objects and time – transcendentism, to give it a name – according to which this relation is indirect, and has to be analysed in terms of the events in which objects participate. Accordingly, for a object to exist at a time is for it to participate in an event which is located at that time. As such, transcendentism is not yet a theory of persistence – insofar as objects may be in time without persisting, i.e. by existing at an instant alone –. Transcendentism is an open option for every kind of persistence theorist – be one an endurantist, a perdurantist, or an exdurantist –. However, the combination of transcendentism and endurantism may reveal itself to be a semantically grounded and metaphysically fruitful choice. Semantically grounded, insofar as the analysis of our temporal semantics speaks against the locative approach and in favour of endurantism. Metaphysically fruitful, insofar as it allows us to frame a theory of persistence that avoids all questionable consequences mentioned before – a theory according to which objects persist without having temporal parts and without being extended simples or multilocated entities. The dissertation consists of four self-standing chapters in which (i) I systematize and highlight the problematicity of the locative approach, (ii) I put forward and articulate the transcendentist alternative, (iii) I develop a suitable metaphysics of events, and (iv) I reply to five objections that have been moved against the view both in official communications and in print.

An important consideration in designing and managing forage systems is the knowledge of the physiological response mechanisms to cutting, especially when water deficit conditions are prevailing. The objective of this study was to determine the physiological response of Medicago sativa and Festuca arundinacea to cutting under different water regimes in a semi-arid Mediterranean region. In a field experiment, two cutting intensities were applied under irrigation and under rainfed (water deficit) conditions. Water potential, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were measured. Based on the results, M. sativa showed higher transpirational water losses under rainfed conditions when compared to those of F. arundinacea, regardless of cutting treatment, because of the higher stomatal conductance. However, leaf water potential remained higher in M. sativa, suggesting a more effective root, stem or leaf related water uptake system. In addition, under water deficit, stomata of M. sativa were less sensitive to low values of water potential, probably resulting in higher productivity when compared to F. arundinacea. Cutting resulted in higher stomatal conductance and, therefore, higher transpiration in both species. Moreover, under water deficit, cutting positively affected water potential, especially in F. arundinacea, alleviating the effect of ageing.
The extent to which dentists influence the outcomes of dental care, compared to the effects of dental technology or patient variation, has not been well studied. A review of the literature on the personality and value structures of dentists and dental students reveals general trends involving preferences of concrete, utilitarian, unambiguous, and conventional situations that are classified and judged in terms of their potential for dentists' power and control and for relationships of helping others but avoiding mutual dependency. These findings are summarized in a hypothesis that dentists seek situations where they can exercise control and establish paternalistic relationships with others. The evidence about career satisfaction of dentists is difficult to interpret. Between 20 percent and 50 percent of dentists report that they would not choose to enter the profession again if given a chance. Yet the number leaving the profession voluntarily is less than the number of career changers in the general population by a factor of about 1 to 15. Career satisfaction of practitioners can be partially predicted from an understanding of dentists' personality and values. Factors such as uncooperative patients, incompetent staff, and government and insurance intrusions are major dissatisfiers; they threaten dentists' core need for control. Factors such as quality of work, which is under the control of dentists, are major satisfiers. The personalities and values of dentists and the expression of these in professional norms may function to limit our understanding of dentistry. Based on this analysis, eight predictions are offered about the profession.
Knowledge Discovery from Databases has more and more impact nowadays and various tools are now available to extract efficiently (in time and memory space) some knowledge from huge databases. Nevertheless, those systems generally produce some large pattern bases and then the management of these one rapidly becomes untractable. Few works have focused on pattern base management systems and researches on that domain are really new. This paper comes within that context, dealing with a particular class of patterns that is association rules. More precisely, we present the way we have efficiently implemented the search for non redundant rules thanks to a representation of rules in the form of bitmap arrays. Some experiments show that the use of this technique increases dramatically the gain in time and space, allowing us to manage large pattern bases.
Peatlands form in areas where net primary of organic matter production exceeds losses due to the decomposition, leaching or disturbance. Due to their chemical and physical characteristics, bogs can influence water dynamics because they can store large volumes of water in the rainy season and gradually release this water during the other months of the year. In Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil, a peatland in the environmental protection area of Pau-de-Fruta ensures the water supply of 40,000 inhabitants. The hypothesis of this study is that the peat bogs in Pau-de-Fruta act as an environment for carbon storage and a regulator of water flow in the Córrego das Pedras basin. The objective of this study was to estimate the water volume and organic matter mass in this peatland and to study the influence of this environment on the water flow in the Córrego das Pedras basin. The peatland was mapped using 57 transects, at intervals of 100 m. Along all transects, the depth of the peat bog, the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates and altitude were recorded every 20 m and used to calculate the area and volume of the peatland. The water volume was estimated, using a method developed in this study, and the mass of organic matter based on samples from 106 profiles. The peatland covered 81.7 hectares (ha), and stored 497,767 m³ of water, representing 83.7 % of the total volume of the peat bog. The total amount of organic matter (OM) was 45,148 t, corresponding to 552 t ha-1 of OM. The peat bog occupies 11.9 % of the area covered by the Córrego das Pedras basin and stores 77.6 % of the annual water surplus, thus controlling the water flow in the basin and consequently regulating the water course.
Abstract Neonatal estrogenization of the mouse with diethylstilbestrol resulted in time‐of‐exposure and dose‐dependent inhibition of the growth of the prostatic lobes observed at the age of 2 mon. The critical time was the days 1–6 of postnatal life. In neonatally estrogenized (neoDES) mice, responses to 5α‐dihydrotestosterone in terms of nuclear 3 H‐thymidine labelling were altered concomitantly with the inhibition of growth and were in accordance with changes in the relative volumes of epithelium, glandular lumina, and interacinar stroma. Secondary estrogen treatment of neoDES mice with 17β‐estradiol did not increase 3 H‐thymidine labelling in the prostate of control or neoDES mice. However, it induced squamous epithelial metaplasia in periurethral collecting ducts and proximal parts of coagulating glands of neoDES animals. In control mice only slight epithelial hyperplasia could be observed after similar treatment. Estrogen receptors, located immunocytochemically in nuclei of stromal cell, corresponded with the sites of increased estrogen sensitivity, observed as metaplastic transformation. When the neoDES animals aged, epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia could be observed at distinct prostatic sites, ie, the periurethral collecting ducts and the coagulating glands and periurethral glands, and stromal inflammation become more extensive. Almost identical location of the epithelial changes and the altered estrogen response is suggestive of causal relationship.

The forced expiratory volume at first second (FEV(1)) during spirometry reflects the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is known to be an important prognostic factor. It is uncertain whether the response to short-acting bronchodilators may predict long-term outcomes such as hospitalizations and mortality.We retrospectively studied a total of 1203 consecutive COPD patients without significant comorbidities during a mean (±SD) of 69 ± 39 months of follow-up. At baseline the subjects were classified as those with positive or negative bronchodilator test (BDT) and also in quartiles of absolute bronchodilator response to 400 μg of salbutamol. Hospital visits and mortality were the end points.A positive bronchodilator test was observed in 332 (27.6%) of the patients. There were 73 (21.9%) deaths in patients with a positive BDT versus 253 (28.7%) in those with a negative BDT (p = 0.04). In adjusted Cox regression analysis a positive BDT was significantly associated with a prolonged time to first hospitalization. After stratifying the population by quartiles of response to BDT, a dose-response relationship was observed with the best outcomes in the quartile with highest level of airflow reversibility, even after controlling for age, sex, BMI, smoking status and baseline postbronchodilator FEV(1).In a large population of well characterized COPD patients without significant comorbidities, those demonstrating higher levels of reversibility at baseline presented better long-term outcomes even after controlling for other known prognostic factors.

In present study, several chitosan derivatives grafted with rosmarinic acid，including chitosan-rosmarinic acid conjugate (CS-RA), chitosan rosmarinic acid salt (CSRA), N,N,N-trimethylated chitosan rosmarinic acid salt (TMCRA), and N-[(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium)propyl]chitosan rosmarinic acid salt (HACRA), were prepared and the effects of different grafting methods on bioactivity of these derivatives were investigated. The structural characterization was identified by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The chitosan derivatives were also evaluated biologically for antioxidant, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Derivatives CSRA, TMCRA, and HACRA prepared through ion exchange method exhibited significant antioxidant ability. All derivatives remarkably inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide and TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 cells without cytotoxicity, especially derivative TMCRA, whose inhibition rate was >50 % at only 250 μg/mL. The results suggested that chitosan quaternary ammonium derivatives grafted with rosmarinic acid possessed better antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties than chitosan, which could be used as drug materials against oxidative and inflammation-related pathological processes.

Abstract A major achievement of the new institutionalism is the formalisation of the idea that certain policies, such as competition law, are more efficient when administered by a politically independent organisation. Based on this insight, several practitioners and scholars criticise the E uropean C ommunity for relying too much on a multitask, collegial, and therefore politicised organisation, the E uropean C ommission. Defining collegiality as the involvement of non‐expert commissioners in the implementation of the EC competition law, this article offers the first interdisciplinary analysis of the causes and consequences of that peculiar E uropean institution. The central finding is that, far from being a mistake or the product of unanticipated consequences, collegiality was a necessary condition for the creation of supranational E uropean law.

Membrane separation has been widely used to address the global water crisis, but is limited by the permselectivity trade-off. Herein, an effective strategy was adopted to overcome this drawback by integrating membrane separation with peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation on a carbon nanotube (CNT) hollow fiber membrane. During the phenolic wastewater treatment, the CNT hollow fiber membrane not only performed as the separation barrier, but also as the catalyst to activate PDS to degrade the micro-size phenol timely. Compared to the sole filtration (33%), the advanced oxidation functions (AOFs)-based membrane has a higher phenol removal rate (97%) under the optimal conditions: neutral condition (pH = 6), 0.5 mM PDS, and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 39.6 s. The separation mechanism was confirmed to be the non-radical reaction pathways (electro-transfer, and 1O2) through radical quenching, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and open circuit potential model. Such results suggested this work exhibited a high promising prospect for the remediation of organic pollution by a CNT hollow fiber membrane with AOFs.
The authors evaluate and advocate the need for comprehensive sexuality education that meets the unique needs of youth who are deaf or hard of hearing, while calling for the expansion of teacher preparation in this critical area. Effective comprehensive sexuality education is designed to prepare young people to become more comfortable with, and informed about, their sexuality. Teachers and parents are key adults in this process. However, the responsibility for preparing teachers to handle sexuality education lies with both the postsecondary teacher preparation program and the administrative team at the individual school; their willingness to provide comprehensive training, current resources, and continued support are crucial to the success of any comprehensive sexuality program. In the individual school, effective guidance of youth who are deaf or hard of hearing in making appropriate decisions about their sexuality is built upon a team that includes not only school staff, but also parents and deaf adults in the community.
A continuous national monitoring program is performed to monitor the levels of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) in both soy and oyster sauces and to assess the dietary intake of 3-MCPD by the general Singapore consumers from sauces. The program involved the requisition of laboratory reports on the 3-MCPD levels in the sauces from importers before importation as well as sampling of sauces at the point of import and at domestic manufacturers for the analysis of 3-MCPD. Out of the 421 soy and oyster sauce samples monitored between January 2000 and April 2002, 376 samples (89.3%) contained 3-MCPD levels at or below the national maximum limit of 0.02 mg/kg. The upper bound average 3-MCPD concentration of all the sauces was 0.45 mg/kg. The estimated average daily dietary intake of 3-MCPD from sauces based on the national maximum limit and based on the upper bound average 3-MCPD level found in the monitoring program were calculated and compared with the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 2 μg/kg body weight. The average daily intake of 3-MCPD by Singapore consumers from sauces was below the TDI and this indicates that there is no health risk associated with the intake of 3-MCPD from sauces. However, consideration has to be taken into account the total 3-MCPD intakes from all food sources in the diet.
Abstract Direct neural recordings from human auditory cortex have demonstrated encoding for acoustic-phonetic features of consonants and vowels. Neural responses also encode distinct acoustic amplitude cues related to timing, such as those that occur at the onset of a sentence after a silent period or the onset of the vowel in each syllable. Here, we used a group reduced rank regression model to show that distributed cortical responses support a low-dimensional latent state representation of temporal context in speech. The timing cues each capture more unique variance than all other phonetic features and exhibit rotational or cyclical dynamics in latent space from activity that is widespread over the superior temporal gyrus. We propose that these spatially distributed timing signals could serve to provide temporal context for, and possibly bind across time, the concurrent processing of individual phonetic features, to compose higher-order phonological (e.g. word-level) representations.
Introduction: Health and social needs exist along a dynamic continuum. Recognizing that health status is inextricably impacted by social determinants of health, there exists opportunities and a professional responsibility to better understand how community paramedicine can address social needs in effort to reduce healthcare inequities.Aim: The primary objective of this scoping review is to systematically investigate published peer reviewed and grey literature to explore how community paramedicine supports social needs along a health and social continuum.Methods: A scoping review of English language literature was conducted using the JBI Scoping Review methodology. We searched CINAHL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE and grey literature searches in Google Scholar and organisational websites. We used search terms related to community paramedicine and social needs. Results: A total of 30 peer-reviewed and 13 grey literature articles met inclusion criteria. The main findings of this scoping review describe the evolving ways community paramedicine models are addressing health and social needs. A key recommendation across the literature was the need to meaningfully engage communities early in program development to understand how best to implement and co-design an integrated service model that addresses the needs specific to each community, though there was a lack of evidence to guide this approach. There is a notable lack of evidence pertaining to how best to optimize technologies in program design and implementation. The results highlight opportunities to determine best practices for conducting holistic community needs assessments that include equitable stakeholder engagement and enhance education to prepare paramedics for expanded roles.Conclusion: Community paramedicine provides opportunities to better meet the needs of structurally marginalised communities. However, there is a social responsibility and opportunity to engage in community needs assessments to co-design service delivery, advance paramedic education, and enhance interprofessional collaboration to better support social needs and generate upstream solutions for individuals and communities.
